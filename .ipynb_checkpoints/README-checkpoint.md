# A/B Testing - 

- A company has introduced a new interface for a recommendation system for EU users
- The funnel consists of 4 events  - Login → product page → product cart → purchase
- Carried out A/B tests to check whether there was a 10% increase in conversions on all 4 events in the funnel compared to the previous interface

### Test Results and Conclusions - 

- Events throughout the funnel did not achieve a 10% increase in conversion
- Only at the last stage, purchase, the new test group showed a 1.11% increase
- This means that more users purchased product in one-click using the ‘Buy Now’ button
- It can be assumed that **EU users prefer to shop in the shortest and fastest way**, skipping stages in the usual sales funnel order. This hypothesis should be tested.


# Purchase Data Analysis - 

Conducted descriptive analysis on purchase data for the game House of Dune

### Observations and conclusions - 

1. A total of **576 unique players** made in-game purchases, with **84.03% being male** and only **14.06% being female**.
2. Females spend, on average, more than males (**$3.20 vs. $3.02**). Therefore, increasing the female player base could greatly increase revenue.
3. The most common age groups of the players are **20-24 yr olds (44.79%)**, followed by **15-19 yr olds (18.58%)** and **25-29 yr olds (13.37%)**.
4. These age groups are more likely to make multiple purchases, as indicated by the higher purchase counts compared to the player counts across all age groups.
5. The majority of the most popular items are also the most profitable items, indicating that the pricing strategy of items is effective and does not detract from the quantity purchased.
